## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

With this dataset, I hope to show my peers the small changes that took place in the NBA over a certain period of time. With the help of the players' data provided by this dataset, I hope to analyse small paterns shown by players as from one season to the next. This dataset provides us with all stats of players, such as their true shooting percentage and their efficiency, which I analysed with hopes of finding small patters.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 wors

I was certain that I wanted to chose a dataset related to the NBA as I have always shown an interest in the sport of basketball and was very curious to explore the true stats of players rather that what we see in highlight clips. I was hoping to find a dataset that was very simple and easy to analyse so that all students would be able to understand by just glancing at it but such datasets were too small to meet the requirements. The dataset I chose was created by Justin Grosz on data.world at https://data.world/jgrosz99/nba-player-data-1978-2016.

This dataset originally included 14000+ rows, as it included player stats from 1978 to 2016, and 100+ columns which included advanced aspects of the NBA that was irrelevent to my analysis so I decided to make it more simple and understandable for everyone. I removed all players' data up until 2011 so my analysis only included player stats from 2011 - 2016, and I also removed many advanced columns and kept the columns that were relevant to my analysis such as the players' true shooting percentage, assist and rebound percentages, which are easier to understand with a simple glance.
